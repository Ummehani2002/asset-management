# 📧 When Will You Receive Delay Emails?

## Two Types of Delay Checks:

### 1. **Standard Hours Exceeded** (Main Check - PRIORITY)
**When:** If you set **1 hour** standard time, you'll get email **AFTER it exceeds 1 hour**

**Example:**
- You set: **1 hour** standard time
- Task starts at: 10:00 AM
- At 11:01 AM (1 hour 1 minute) → **Email sent immediately** (within 5 minutes)
- Reminder emails sent every 1 hour until completed

### 2. **Deadline Passed** (Secondary Check)
**When:** If job card date + 1 day has passed

**Example:**
- Job card date: December 16, 2025
- Deadline: December 17, 2025 (end of day)
- If task still in progress after December 17 → Email sent

## Which One Triggers First?

**Standard Hours is checked FIRST** (priority)

- If you set 1 hour → Email sent **AFTER 1 hour** (not after 1 day)
- The 1-day deadline is a backup check if standard hours check doesn't trigger

## Timeline Example:

**Task with 1 hour standard time:**
- 10:00 AM - Task created and starts
- 11:00 AM - Task reaches 1 hour (still OK)
- 11:01 AM - Task exceeds 1 hour → **Email sent** (within 5 minutes)
- 12:01 PM - Reminder email sent (1 hour later)
- 1:01 PM - Another reminder email sent
- And so on... until task is completed

## Summary:

✅ **If you set 1 hour → Email sent AFTER it exceeds 1 hour**  
✅ **Not after 1 day**  
✅ **Reminder emails every 1 hour until completed**

The 1-day deadline is a separate safety check for tasks that might have very long standard hours.
